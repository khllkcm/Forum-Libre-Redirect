# Forum Libre Redirect

The script scrapes r/France for the daily Forum Libre thread and serves its URL on a subdirectory of my domain.

Instead of sifting through posts to access the thread, one can just bookmark [this link](https://kacem.xyz/FL) and each day it will take them to the correct thread.
